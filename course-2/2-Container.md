A Container Image, in its simplest definition, is a file which is pulled down from a Registry Server and used locally as a mount point when starting Containers. A container is the runtime instantiation of an image.

A Container Engine is a piece of software that accepts user requests, including command line options, pulls images, and from the end user's perspective runs the container.

There are many container engines, including Docker, RKT, and CRI-O that provide the runtime environment for the applications inside the container.

You can run them locally or on a remote server.

Docker containers that run on Docker Engine are lightweight, portable and secure. They run everywhere: Linux, Windows, Data center, Cloud, Serverless, etc.

Docker Build is at the core of what makes Docker so popular. It allows you to easily create and share portable Docker container images using open standards and create images for multiple CPU and OS architectures and share them in your private registry or on Docker Hub.

Docker Desktop is an application for MacOS and Windows machines for the building and sharing of containerized applications and microservices.

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
