Step 3: Join your nodes to your Kubernetes cluster

You can now join any number of machines by running the kubeadm join command on each node as root.

To join kube-02 and kube-03 as worker nodes to the cluster, we need the token generated by the kubeadm init command.

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

```
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

output

```
kubeadm join 10.5.1.94:6443 --token qtzbiv.q7yohe8xz7plymqo     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:65db7dd872b85b7e3116b0639763771b980f8c1e269b94534cb424da08a2122f 
```

Copy the output and run it on both worker nodes {kube-02, kube-03}.

When you join your worker nodes you will see the following output:

To check that all nodes are now joined to the Control Plane run the following command on the Kubernetes Control Plane node:

```
kubectl get nodes
```

Status will remain NotReady until we configure networking on the Control Plane node in the next challenge.
