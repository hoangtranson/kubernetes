Step 5: Deploying The Microservices Sock Shop

Next we will deploy a demo microservices application to your kubernetes cluster.

First, on Control Plane, clone the microservices sock shop git repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo.git
```

Go to the microservices-demo/deploy/kubernetes folder:

```
cd microservices-demo/deploy/kubernetes
```

Next apply the demo to your kubernetes cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f complete-demo.yaml
```

Check to see if all of your pods are running:


```
watch kubectl get pods --namespace sock-shop
```
