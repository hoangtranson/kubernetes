A Deployment controller provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

You describe a desired state in a Deployment object, and the Deployment controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.

Deployment manages the ReplicaSet to orchestrate Pod lifecycles. This includes Pod creation, upgrade and deletion, and scaling.
