Step 4: Setup a Kubernetes Add-On For Networking

Kubernetes Add-Ons are pods and services that implement cluster features. Pods extend the functionality of Kubernetes. You can install addons for a range of cluster features including Networking and Visualization.

We are going to install the Weave Net Add-On on the kube-01 Control Plane, which provides networking and network policy, will carry on work on both sides of a network partition, and does not require an external database. Read more about the Weave Net Add-on in the Weave Works Docs.

Weave-net is a CNI plugin which provides a virtual network that connects docker containers across multiple hosts.

By default Kubernetes comes with a simple network plugin that does not have the overlay networking capabilities.

Next you will deploy a pod network to the cluster.

The options are listed at: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

Installing the Weave Net Add-On
On the Control Plane node, run the kubectl apply command which will create all the networking resources in the cluster from the supplied manifest file:

It may take a minute or two for DNS to be ready, continue to check for DNS to be ready before moving on by running the kubectl get command which allow us to display the resources and prints a table of the most important information about the specified resources:

Check the nodes status again:

```
kubectl get nodes
```
