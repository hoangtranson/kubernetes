# Step by Step backup procedure

## Step 1: Add the Kasten K10 Helm repository
The Helm package manager (v3.0.0+) and the Kasten Helm charts repository is required (https://helm.sh/)

Installing K10 via helm will also automatically create a new Service Account to grant K10 the required access to Kubernetes resources.

## Step 2: Install K10
Following a successful installation, there are several options for setting up access to the Kasten K10 dashboard. For more information, refer to Dashboard Access (https://docs.kasten.io/latest/access/dashboard.html#dashboard).

## Step 3: Backup Policy Creation
K10 gives you the ability, with extremely minor application modifications, to add functionality to backup, restore, and migrate application data in an efficient and transparent manner.

## Step 4: Restore from Backup
Restore the data using K10 by selecting the appropriate restore point.
