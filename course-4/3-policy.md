# Policies

Policies are used to automate your data management workflows. A Policy custom resource (CR) is used to perform operations on K10 Policies.

K10 Policies allow you to manage application protection and migration at scale.

You can learn more about using K10 Policies in the Protecting Applications (https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/protect.html#protect) section.

## Policy Scheduling

Within the Policy API Type, K10 provides control of:

- How often the primary snapshot or import action should be performed
- How often snapshots should be exported into backups
- Which and how many snapshots and backups to retain
- When the primary snapshot or import action should be performed
